# TypeScript Roguelike
This is my work for [/r/roguelikedev's yearly Roguelike tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/8ql895/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/). It is written in TypeScript using [ROT.js](https://ondras.github.io/rot.js).

You can play it [here](https://jackbister.github.io/ts-roguelike/).
